EMG Algorithmn

Description

This project was to create a program that could take raw EMG data from an Arduino, process the data, and ptrain and test it on an NN. 
This was to match the movments of a real hand and moving fowrad to be applied to copying hand motions in a virtual reality environment.

Functionality

Processing - Data is processed and cleaned to be passed through the NN
Training - Neural net would use labelled data sets to train the net to accurately predict hand motions from emg data
Real Time usage - Pass real time data through the NN to show predicted hand movements from a live feed.

Language

-Python

Tools

-Sklearn
-NumPy
-Pandas
